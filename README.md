# An Intro to VR & A-Frame
An introduction to VR and building VR experiences with A-Frame

## What is Virtual Reality?
Virtual Reality, or VR, simulates a user’s physical presence in a virtual or imaginary environment

I’m going to specifically refer to these as VR experiences, because VR is more than just games. There’s VR film and video, documentaries, news stories, journals, adventures, and more.

### Examples of VR
- 

### Criticisms to VR
- Accessibility to enjoy (equipment, culture)
- Accessibility to develop (isolated)
- Misguided “Empathy Machines”
- Sexual Harassment possibilities

## What is A-Frame?
A web framework for building virtual reality experiences
- is open-source and accessible by web
- has a deep, small community backed by Mozilla
- uses markup that looks like HTML to be placed in .html files
- encourages fast development/prototyping

### Examples of A-Frame
- 

### Useful Concepts
- Uses 3D coordinate space like (0, 0, 1)
- Controlled by a Camera
- Assets are 3D shapes (primitives) or 3D models, or more
- Some special effects are made with particle effects
